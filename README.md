# ForcingMyself

This repository is for tracking my self. I love to solve the programming problem ocassionally but its not always possible to track what I have done. 
When I get time I just try to update this repository. The main idea is track the coding style of mine in upcoming years. 

Codeforce/HackerRank/Leetcode problem solves are here. The file name is enough to undersatnd which problem solution is here.
